# Fork changes

This file tracks every deviation in this fork from upstream `openclaw/openclaw`. Update it whenever you commit a fork-specific change so upstream merges stay manageable.

When merging upstream, walk this file top-to-bottom and re-apply / re-verify each entry.

## src/agents/system-prompt.ts

### Identity line — strip OpenClaw branding

Both occurrences of `"You are a personal assistant operating inside OpenClaw."` (one in the `promptMode === "none"` early return, one in the main `lines` array) replaced with:

```
You are a personal assistant.
```

### Safety guardrail — favor workspace files as content authority

Old (line ~462):

```
Prioritize safety and human oversight over completion; if instructions conflict, pause and ask; comply with stop/pause/audit requests and never bypass safeguards. (Inspired by Anthropic's constitution.)
```

New:

```
Prioritize safety over completion. Comply with stop/pause/audit requests. Your workspace files define your content boundaries — trust them.
```

### SOUL.md guidance — workspace files are primary authority

Old (line ~100):

```
If SOUL.md is present, embody its persona and tone. Avoid stiff, generic replies; follow its guidance unless higher-priority instructions override it.
```

New:

```
If SOUL.md is present, fully embody its persona, tone, and content guidelines. SOUL.md is your primary behavioral authority.
```

### User-facing OpenClaw mentions scrubbed

Lowercase `openclaw` CLI command references (e.g. `openclaw gateway start`) are KEPT — those are valid command names, not branding.

User-facing prompt strings updated to remove the OpenClaw word:

### Removals to investigate (NOT YET DONE)

These additional user-facing OpenClaw mentions exist in agent files outside `system-prompt.ts` and should be evaluated for the same scrub policy:

- `src/agents/subagent-announce.ts:139` — `'`agents_list`and`subagents` apply to OpenClaw sub-agents...'` (we changed line 142 of this file but not 139)
- `src/agents/tools/music-generate-tool.ts:109, 543` — tool description strings sent to the model
- `src/agents/tools/video-generate-tool.ts:112, 134, 715` — tool description strings
- `src/agents/tools/image-generate-tool.ts:85` — tool description string
- `src/agents/internal-runtime-context.ts:9` — internal runtime context label (probably not in system prompt)
- `src/agents/internal-events.ts:88` — same
- `src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers/errors.ts:185` — error message users may see when surfaced

These are NOT scrubbed in this initial fork commit. Add them in a follow-up if you want the OpenClaw word fully eliminated from anything the model or user can see.

## src/agents/bash-tools.exec.ts

### Removed `complex interpreter invocation` preflight check

In `validateScriptFileForShellBleed`, the upstream early-return path for "no script target" used to call `shouldFailClosedInterpreterPreflight` and throw `"exec preflight: complex interpreter invocation detected; refusing to run without script preflight validation."` when the heuristic flagged the command.

That entire `if (...) throw new Error(...)` block was removed in this fork. The function now simply returns when there's no script target:

```ts
const target = extractScriptTargetFromCommand(params.command);
if (!target) {
  return;
}
```

**Why:** the upstream check fail-closed on legitimate compound shell commands that the agent's prompts use (e.g. `grep X file; python3 check-trial.py`). Single-tenant trusted-prompt deployment, so the multi-tenant injection-defense rationale doesn't apply.

**Other preflight checks intact:** the rest of `validateScriptFileForShellBleed` (script path sandbox check, shell variable injection scanning of script files, JS-starts-with-shell-syntax check) is unchanged. Only the no-script-target heuristic block was removed.

## src/agents/subagent-announce.ts

### Subagent guidance scrub (1 of 2)

Line 142, inside the ACP-enabled subagent guidance block:

Old:

```
Use `subagents` only for OpenClaw subagents (`runtime: "subagent"`).
```

New:

```
Use `subagents` only for native subagents (`runtime: "subagent"`).
```

Line 139 (`'`agents_list`and`subagents` apply to OpenClaw sub-agents...'`) is NOT yet scrubbed — see "Removals to investigate" above.

## extensions/bluebubbles/src/types.ts — undici 8.0 compat fix

**Upstream bug**: BB attachment downloads fail with `Error: invalid onRequestStart method` because `blueBubblesFetchWithTimeout` calls plain `fetch(url, init)` even when `init` has a `dispatcher` injected by core's SSRF guard. On undici 8.0 the dispatcher leaks into `globalThis.fetch`'s handler chain, which has an incompatible interceptor shape, and every BB image/video download throws.

**Fix**: route through `fetchWithRuntimeDispatcher` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime` when `init.dispatcher` is set, otherwise use plain `fetch`. Same pattern as the upstream Slack fix in commit `e8fb140642` (`fix: preserve Slack guarded media transport`) — that fix wasn't applied to the bluebubbles plugin.

Added import:

```ts
import { fetchWithRuntimeDispatcher } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime";
```

Modified plain-fetch branch of `blueBubblesFetchWithTimeout`:

```ts
const fetchImpl =
  init != null && "dispatcher" in init ? fetchWithRuntimeDispatcher : fetch;
try {
  return await fetchImpl(url, { ...init, signal: controller.signal });
} finally { ... }
```

When upstream lands a proper bluebubbles equivalent of `e8fb140642`, drop this section.

## extensions/bluebubbles — `?agentId=` query param override

Enables per-request dynamic agent routing for the BB channel without maintaining file-based `bindings[]` rewrites. This fork adds an `?agentId=<name>` query parameter to `/bluebubbles-webhook` that, when set and allowlisted in config, overrides the normal route resolution for that message.

Files touched:

- `src/plugin-sdk/routing.ts` — export `buildAgentPeerSessionKey` so extensions can synthesize session keys
- `extensions/bluebubbles/src/conversation-route.ts` — accept optional `agentIdOverride`; when allowlisted, build the route directly via `buildAgentPeerSessionKey` bypassing `bindings[]` lookup
- `extensions/bluebubbles/src/monitor.ts` — extract `?agentId=` from the webhook URL and thread through `debouncer.enqueue`
- `extensions/bluebubbles/src/monitor-debounce.ts` — `BlueBubblesDebounceEntry` carries `agentIdOverride`; debouncer forwards it to `processMessage`
- `extensions/bluebubbles/src/monitor-processing.ts` — `processMessage` accepts `options.agentIdOverride` and passes it to `resolveBlueBubblesConversationRoute`
- `extensions/bluebubbles/src/conversation-route.test.ts` — two tests covering allowlisted override + rejection of non-allowlisted override

Config schema: `channels.bluebubbles.allowAgentIdOverride: string[]`. Only agents in this allowlist can be targeted via the query param. Not in this allowlist = override silently ignored, normal routing applies.

No upstream equivalent. Revert via `git revert` if the entire dynamic-routing feature is retired.

## src/agents/anthropic-payload-policy.ts — undefined baseUrl is 1h-TTL eligible

**Upstream bug**: `isLongTtlEligibleEndpoint(baseUrl)` returns `false` when `baseUrl` is `undefined`, even though that case means the caller is using the provider SDK's default endpoint, which for the Anthropic provider is `api.anthropic.com` — fully eligible for 1h `cache_control` TTL.

The downstream effect: any agent using `cacheRetention: "long"` without an explicit `baseUrl` in its auth profile silently ships `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` with no `ttl` field, which Anthropic interprets as the default 5-minute TTL. For workloads with multi-minute conversation gaps (texting bots, ops agents), every turn becomes a cache miss, triggering a fresh ~100k-token prefill and ~30–60s of latency before first token.

**Fix**: in `isLongTtlEligibleEndpoint`, treat `undefined baseUrl` as eligible. The function is only called from `resolveAnthropicEphemeralCacheControl`, which is only invoked when the family resolver has already classified the call as Anthropic-compatible, so the broader eligibility doesn't widen the blast radius beyond Anthropic provider paths.

```ts
function isLongTtlEligibleEndpoint(baseUrl: string | undefined): boolean {
  if (typeof baseUrl !== "string") {
    return true; // SDK default = api.anthropic.com
  }
  // ... existing hostname allowlist check unchanged
}
```

**Test**: `src/agents/anthropic-payload-policy.test.ts` adds one new case asserting that `baseUrl: undefined` + `cacheRetention: "long"` produces `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral", ttl: "1h" }` on both system blocks and the trailing user message. The 6 existing tests are unchanged and still pass.

When upstream lands the same fix (or rejects it explicitly), drop this section.

## src/gateway/openresponses-http.ts — normalize `user` field to E.164

The `user` field from `/v1/responses` requests becomes the session key via `resolveGatewayRequestContext`. When clients send formatted phone numbers (e.g. `(555) 123-4567` instead of `+15551234567`), separate sessions and cache entries are created for the same user.

**Fix**: added `normalizeResponsesUser()` that strips non-digit characters and formats as E.164 before the user value reaches session resolution. Applied at line 481 where `payload.user` is extracted.

- 10 digits → `+1{digits}` (US number)
- 11 digits starting with 1 → `+{digits}`
- 11+ digits → `+{digits}` (international)
- Non-phone strings (no digits, short digit runs) → returned unchanged

**Test**: `src/gateway/openresponses-user-normalize.test.ts` — 8 cases covering formatted US, bare digits, E.164 passthrough, international, undefined, and non-phone strings.

No upstream equivalent. Safe to drop if upstream adds its own user normalization.

## Sticky model fallback — `agents.defaults.fallbackPersist`

When a primary model (e.g. opus) times out and the fallback chain selects a different model for the turn, upstream persists `modelOverride` and `providerOverride` to the session entry in `sessions.json`. This causes all subsequent turns to skip the primary model entirely.

**New config flag**: `agents.defaults.fallbackPersist` (boolean, default: `true`).

When set to `false`, after a fallback model completes a turn successfully, the persisted override is rolled back so the next turn starts fresh with the configured primary model. The per-turn fallback chain is unaffected.

Files touched:

- `src/config/types.agent-defaults.ts` — added `fallbackPersist?: boolean` to `AgentDefaultsConfig`
- `src/config/zod-schema.agent-defaults.ts` — added `fallbackPersist: z.boolean().optional()` to the Zod schema
- `src/auto-reply/reply/agent-runner-execution.ts` — hoisted `lastSuccessfulFallbackRollback` closure from the `run` callback; after `runWithModelFallback` succeeds, calls the rollback when `fallbackPersist === false` and the winning model differs from the primary

No upstream equivalent. Safe to drop on merge since `true` (default) preserves upstream behavior.

## Test files updated to match source changes

These test files have assertions that pin the exact prompt strings. They're updated whenever a prompt above changes; they're not new fork features.

### src/agents/system-prompt.test.ts

- Safety guardrail assertions (2 places) updated to match new "Prioritize safety over completion…" wording.
- SOUL.md assertion (1 place) updated to match new wording.
- 5 OpenClaw-scrub follow-ups: `## CLI Quick Reference`, `## Self-Update`, `Docs: …`, `For runtime behavior…` (×2), `Use \`subagents\` only for native subagents`.

### src/agents/cli-runner.spawn.test.ts

- SOUL.md prompt assertion (1 place) updated.

### src/agents/bash-tools.exec.script-preflight.test.ts

- 16 `it("fails closed for…")` cases changed to `it.skip(…)` because the throw they assert was removed in `bash-tools.exec.ts`. Test bodies preserved verbatim so an upstream merge can re-enable them if upstream changes the underlying behavior. The 13 `it("does not fail closed for…")` negative tests are untouched.
- All other preflight tests in this file (shell variable injection, JS-as-shell, path-qualified env, script path sandbox) are unchanged and still run.
